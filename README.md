# HooverEats
An app that allows DePauw Students to share and match people with meal swipes. Works similarly to the ride-sharing app, hence the name. <br />

The idea is to allow Freshman and Sophomores, who have lots of meal swipes, to connect and network with Upperclassmen, who have fewer meal swipes.

# Current Status
The app is being developed using:

* reactjs for the front-end
* spring-boot, mysql for back-end
* docker for deployment
